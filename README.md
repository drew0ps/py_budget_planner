Python Budget Planner with Nix

This project uses Nix to create a reproducible Python 3.11 environment with full Tkinter support (python311Full). The environment automatically sets up a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies from requirements.txt.

⸻

Setup & Running

Prerequisites
	•	Install Nix package manager on your system.
	•	Make sure nix is available in your terminal.

⸻

Start the development shell

Run this command in the project root where shell.nix is located:
nix-shell

This will:
	•	Drop you into a shell with Python 3.11 Full environment.
	•	Automatically create and activate a virtual environment .venv if it doesn’t exist.
	•	Install dependencies from requirements.txt into the virtual environment.
	•	Show a confirmation message.

⸻

Run the app

Once inside the nix shell (with the venv activated), run:
python src/main.py

Notes
	•	python311Full ensures Tkinter is included, so GUI apps using Tkinter (or customtkinter) will work correctly.
	•	The virtual environment .venv helps isolate project dependencies.
	•	Modify requirements.txt to add or update Python packages.

Happy coding! 🐍✨
